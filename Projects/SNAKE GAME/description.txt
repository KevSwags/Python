This code is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game involves controlling a snake as it moves around the screen,
trying to eat food and grow longer without crashing into the boundaries of the game screen or into its own body.


Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
Import necessary libraries: The code begins by importing the required modules: tkinter for the graphical user interface and random for generating random positions
for the food.

Define constants: Several constants are defined for the game, including speed, space size, body parts, colors, and game dimensions.

Define the next function: This function controls the movement of the snake and the game's logic. It updates the snake's position, checks for collisions with food, 
handles scoring, deletes tail segments, and checks for game over conditions.

Define the crash function: This function checks whether the snake has collided with the boundaries of the game screen or with itself.

Define the Snake class: This class represents the snake in the game. It initializes the snake's properties, including its coordinates, size, and individual body 
part squares.

Define the Food class: This class represents the food that the snake tries to eat. It initializes the food's coordinates with random values.

Define the change_direction function: This function updates the snake's direction based on the player's input (arrow keys or 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys).

Define the game_over function: This function displays a game over message on the screen with a message that varies based on the player's score.

Set up the Tkinter GUI: The code creates a Tkinter window, sets the title, and initializes the score and direction variables. It also creates a label to display 
the score and a canvas to draw the game elements.

Bind key events: The code binds key events to the change_direction function, allowing the player to control the snake using arrow keys or 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys.

Initialize the snake and food: Instances of the Snake and Food classes are created.

Start the game loop: The next function is called to start the game loop. It continuously updates the game elements, handles movements, collisions, and scoring.

Enter the Tkinter main loop: The window.mainloop() call enters the main loop of the Tkinter application, allowing the game to run and respond to player input.
