creates a simple calculator using the Tkinter library in Python. The code first imports the Tkinter library and then defines a few functions:

button_press(): This function is called when a button is pressed. It takes a number as input and appends it to the equation_text variable. 
The equation_text variable stores the current expression that is being entered into the calculator.

equals(): This function is called when the "=" button is pressed. It evaluates the expression in the equation_text variable and displays the result in the calculator display.

clear(): This function clears the calculator display.

The code then creates a window and a frame. The frame contains the buttons for the numbers and operators. The buttons are all linked to the button_press() function.
The "=" button is linked to the equals() function and the "clear" button is linked to the clear() function.
The code then enters the main loop, which waits for user input. When the user presses a button, the corresponding function is called. 
The main loop continues until the user closes the window.
